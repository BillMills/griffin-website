                        <p class='splashText'>GRIFFIN is designed for decay spectroscopy, the study of the radiation emitted when radioactive nuclei decay. Our facility supports a broad spectrum of research in three major fields: in nuclear structure, GRIFFIN helps understand how the properties of nuclei change based on their composition; in nuclear astrophysics, it studies nuclei along the r-process path (thought to be the mechanism for how the heavy chemical elements are formed in the universe); and in fundamental symmetries, it performs precision studies of super-allowed fermi beta decays in a particular subset of nuclei that have the same number of protons and neutrons, as well as measurements for the Radon Electric Dipole Moment program at ISAC. </p>

                    <h2>Nuclear Structure</h2>
                </div>

                <div class='row'>
                    <div class='col-md-6'>
                        <p>The atomic nucleus is a strongly-interacting, many-body quantum mechanical system that exhibits a fascinating variety of shapes and excitation modes, from spherical to super deformed (axis ratio 2:1), and from excitations of single protons and neutrons to collective vibrations and rotations of the nucleus as a whole. The study of nuclear structure attempts to elucidate the unifying mechanisms by which these rich patterns of behavior emerge from the common underlying strong nuclear interaction between the nucleons (protons and neutrons) that form the nucleus. </p>

                        <p>Central to these studies is the concept of nuclear shell structure, in which protons and neutrons occupy quantized energy levels within a potential generated by their interactions with all of the other nucleons. As shown on the left side of Fig. 1, these quantized energy levels cluster into groups, or shells, and the filling of major energy shells leads to particularly stable configurations associated with the proton and neutron "magic numbers": 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. Nuclei near closed shells tend to have spherical ground states, while those far from shell closures are deformed and exhibit low-energy collective rotational excitations.</p>

                        <p>While the nuclear shell structure and magic numbers have been well studied close to the "valley of stability" defined by the ~ 300 stable isotopes found in nature (black pixels in Fig. 2), investigations of exotic nuclei with unusual proton-to-neutron ratios are revealing an evolution of this shell structure (right side of Fig. 1) as one moves away from the stable isotopes. Understanding of this complex evolution of nuclear shell structure is of fundamental interest both as an emergent property of the nuclear quantum many-body system and as an important input to understanding the nuclear reaction processes by which the heavy chemical elements have been, and continue to be, synthesized in explosive astrophysical environments. As shown schematically in Fig. 3, nuclear shell structure in extremely neutron-rich nuclei is thought to play a major role in the pathway for the rapid neutron capture (r) process, thought to be responsible for producing approximately half of the elements heavier than iron. Neither the exact locations of the shell gaps in these neutron-rich isotopes, nor the exact astrophysical events in which the r-process takes place, are, however, established at present.</p>

                        <p>Gamma-ray spectroscopy provides powerful techniques to study nuclear shell structure through measurements of gamma-ray energies and angular correlations in low-energy decay experiments and through measurements of electromagnetic transition matrix elements between nuclear states in Coulomb excitation experiments with accelerated radioactive ion beams. At present, the 8pi Spectrometer and its auxiliary detectors support our decay spectroscopy studies at ISAC-I, while the TIGRESS spectrometer is used in our experiments with accelerated radioactive beams at ISAC-II. We are also currently developing the state-of-the-art new GRIFFIN spectrometer that will provide 300 times higher gamma-gamma coincidence detection efficiency than the 8pi Spectrometer and revolutionize the decay spectroscopy program at ISAC-I, as well as the DESCANT neutron detector array that will be used for gamma-neutron coincidence studies in conjunction with both TIGRESS at ISAC-II and GRIFFIN at ISAC-I. </p>

                    <h2>Superallowed Beta Decay</h2>
                </div>

                <div class='row'>
                    <div class='col-md-6'>
                        <p>The process of nuclear beta decay takes place when the nucleus contains an excess of protons or neutrons relative to the combinations that form stable isotopes. Beta decay then converts a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron, to achieve a more strongly bound, or stable, configuration of nucleons. </p>

                        <p>Considering the quarks substructure of the nucleons, the neutron is comprised of two "down" type quarks and one "up" type quark, while the proton is comprised of two "up" type quarks and one "down" type. As shown in Fig. 1, the beta decay process thus corresponds to the conversion of a down quark to an up quark, converting the neutron into a proton, with the emission of a virtual W- particle that decays into an electron and an anti-electron neutrino. Conversely, the conversion of an up quark in a proton to a down quark results in a neutron and a virtual W+ particle that decays to a positron and electron neutrino. These processes are governed by the weak nuclear interaction, which is unified with electromagnetism in the Standard Model of particle physics to form the electroweak force. </p>

                        <p>For a particular subset of nuclear beta decays, known as superallowed beta decays, the quantum-mechanical wavefunction of the entire nucleus is left essentially unchanged by the beta decay process with the exception of one proton being converted into a neutron. These special decays are particularly amenable to theoretical analysis and precise experimental measurements for superallowed beta decays thus provide demanding tests of the Standard Model description of electroweak interactions. For example, while the half-lives associated with the full range of nuclear beta decays span some 20 orders of magnitude (from thousandths of a second to billions of years), Fig. 2 shows that all 13 of the superallowed Fermi beta decays that have been measured precisely to date have identical (within their error bars) intrinsic strengths, confirming the Conserved Vector Current (CVC) hypothesis of the Standard Model at the level of 0.01% precision. These superallowed beta decay data also currently provide the most precise determination of the "up-down" element of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix that describes the transformation between the mass eigenstates and the weak interaction eigenstates of the Standard Model quarks. </p>

                    <div class='col-md-6'>
                        <p>As illustrated in Fig. 1, the orientation of an intrinsic electric dipole moment (EDM) of a particle, relative to its intrinsic angular momentum or spin, changes sign under both the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) operations. A non-zero permanent EDM for an elementary particle or atom can thus only arise from the polarization of the system by parity and time-reversal violating fundamental interactions. No such particle EDM has ever been measured, despite 5 decades of searches with ever increasing experimental sensitivity. </p>

                        <p>The global effort to perform more and more precise searches for particle EDM's is motivated by our desire to understand the fundamental symmetries of the laws of physics and the most basic origins of matter in our universe. All of the experimental evidence available to date supports the theoretically motivated expectation that all of the physical laws remain unchanged under the combined operation of CPT-reversal, where CP-reversal exchanges particles with their anti-particle partners. Assuming the validity of this CPT symmetry, the observation of a time-reversal (T) violating electric dipole moment would imply the existence of new fundamental CP-violating fundamental interactions in nature. </p>

                        <p>Additional sources of CP-violation are required to account for the observed imbalance between matter and anti-matter in our universe, as the CP-violation within the currently known Standard Model of particle physics is far too weak to do so. Many of the proposed models of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry (SUSY), theories with multiple Higgs bosons, and left-right symmetric models, naturally include such additional sources of CP-violation that could account for the cosmic matter/antimatter asymmetry. These CP-violating interactions also generically lead to predictions for particle electric dipole moments at, or tantalizingly close to, the current level of experimental sensitivity. EDM measurements thus provide demanding tests of physics beyond the Standard Model, and important constraints on the models of new physics required to explain the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the universe. </p>

                            <figcaption><b>Figure 1:</b> At left a particle with intrinsic spin angular momentum in the upward direction (suggested by the circumferential arrow of "rotation") is shown with both a magnetic dipole moment (mu) and an electric dipole moment (d). The relationship between the common magnetic dipole moment mu and the intrinsic spin remains unchanged under both the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) operations. The relationship between an EDM and the intrinsic spin, however, changes sign under both P and T reversal. A particle with a non-zero EDM thus transforms into a distinguishable particle under the P and T operations, and is said to violate these symmetries. While parity violation (due to the weak nuclear interaction) is well known in the current laws of physics, time-reversal violation is not and a non-zero particle EDM has not yet been discovered. </figcaption>
